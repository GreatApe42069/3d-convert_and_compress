# 3d-convert_and_compress
This Python script is designed to convert various 3D file formats (e.g., .obj, .fbx, .usdz) to GLTF (.gltf) using the `gltfpack` tool. The goal is to achieve a file size of around 65KB without compromising the integrity of the pixels. The script utilizes the `gltfpack` tool for efficient compression.
